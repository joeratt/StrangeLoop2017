Easier for you to get to iOS and Android
- Goal: Build the best way to build for Mobile
- Today: you have to have 2-3 teams to do all mobile platforms

# Fluid
- Keep developers in the zone. Get them home early

## Hot Reload
- you can stay on-screen in your app, rather than having to re-launch app

## Tech: Language & Toolchain
- started in JS
- Dart - using Google's Dart for development: (DartLang.org)[https://www.dartlang.org/]
  - Fast Development Cycle
  - Optional, but strong typing System
  - "tree shaking compiler" - removes dead code
  - GC
  - Similar to Java or JS

# Flexible
- Wanted to make it easier to not have to do cookie-cutter apps


# Notes
- You can use Intellij, XCode, etc.
- Quickly updates UI
- Looks pretty straight-forward (Java-like Language)

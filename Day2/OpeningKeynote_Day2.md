# Open source contributions
Problem: Open Source Projects don't respond to contributions
- Possibly: Maintainer may be burried in PRs / Issues

# Number of Contributors Are Growing
- SourceForge (2001) 120K Users
- Github (2017) 20M Users

> Two-thirds of popular projects have just 1-2 maintainers

> 94% of companies use open source at least sometimes at work

## Negative Press
Equifax - Blamed Apache Struts, but really they didn't patch security fix

# Maintainers do more than write code

## Maintainers are the "keystone species" of software development

- When maintainers are happy, everybody benefits
- Conversely, when maintainers are overwhelmed, everybody suffers

## Maintainers are trying to cope
- Issue templates are a "best practice"
  - More of a way to impede Users
- Maintainers are volunteers

# Why aren't users becoming contributors?
- In 2001: Getting people used to open source
  - "Cathedral-style" software development
  - "bazaar-style" software development
    - lots of people reviewing, contributing
- Today: Scalability of production
  - more developers today (many new)
  - ~ 93% of npm packages have one maintainer
  - Software is getting smaller
    - One maintainer tends to have multiple projects
  - bazaar-style doesn't happen today: most projects have < 10 contributors
  - Not all contributors want to come back (that's ok!)
    - The "2nd time contributor problem"
      - Maintainers may spend countless hours helping lots of people make their first contribution.

# What does it cost _us_ to pursue the better strategy?
- How do we support maintainers?
  - how do we make it a viable path of work?
  - Indirect: Dedicated employer time
    - encourage open-source contributions at work
    - advocate internally
    - carving out work time is probably the most viable option

  - Independent: Raise money
    - Enterprise editions (charge for large use)
    - Fund raising / sponsors (i.e., Kickstarter)

  - Infrastructure: Treat open source like digital infrastructure
    - lots of "get lucky" stories
    - hiring people to dedicate time to it
      - corporate / philanthropy needed
    - How do we get there?
      - Risk vs. Opportunity
      - decentralized & global (community-built)
        - no obvious entity that can take responsibility for long-term growth
      - We need to figure out how to economically value open source
